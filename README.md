# ⚡ Ohm's Law Simulation

This is a simple interactive web simulation demonstrating **Ohm’s Law**:  
> _V = I × R_  
Where:
- **V** is Voltage (Volts)
- **I** is Current (Amperes)
- **R** is Resistance (Ohms)

## 🚀 Features

- Adjustable sliders for Voltage and Resistance
- Real-time calculation of Current
- Visual feedback using basic circuit illustrations
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Lightweight and fast — perfect for educational use

## 💻 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- FTP Deployment to shared hosting via GitHub Secrets

## 📂 Project Structure

Deployment is automatically triggered on every push to the `main` branch using FTP. Secrets used:

- `FTP_HOST`
- `FTP_USERNAME`
- `FTP_PASSWORD`
- `FTP_PORT`
- `FTP_TARGET_DIR`

## ✅ How to Contribute

Feel free to fork, open issues, or submit pull requests to improve the simulation or UI design.
